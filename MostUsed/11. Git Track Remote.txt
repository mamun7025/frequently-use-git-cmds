
------------ Git Track Remote ---------------------
which local branch is tracking which remote branch in Git?

git remote show origin

For all branches: git branch -avv
For local branches only: git branch -lvv
For remote branches only: git branch -rvv




-------------- How can I tell a local branch to track a remote branch
git checkout --track origin/dev
Branch dev set up to track remote branch dev from origin.
Switched to a new branch 'dev'


git remote prune
git remote prune origin
